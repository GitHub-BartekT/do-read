# checking authorization and authentication path:
# User - "someTestUser", password='somePassword' - not registered
# Access Token, Refresh Token
# Endpoints:
    # public

Step 7: user tried to get JWT token by requesting POST /auth/signin with username="someTestUser", password="someTestPassword"

Step 8: User made GET /users/modules with header “Authorization: DDDD.EEEE.FFF”
        and system returned UNAUTHORIZED
Step 9: user made GET /users/modules with header “Authorization: Bearer AAAA.BBBB.CCC”

Step 11:    user made GET /admin/modules with header “Authorization: Bearer AAAA.BBBB.CCC”
            and system returned UNAUTHORIZED
Step 12:    the access token has expired

            and system returned UNAUTHORIZED
Step 14:    User made POST /auth/refresh with body “{"token":"DDDD.EEEE.FFF”}"
