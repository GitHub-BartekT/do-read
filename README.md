Program helps children learn to read.

## How it works
### Problem
In book “How to teach your baby to read” by Glenn and Janet Doman is described method of teaching toddlers and preschool children reading.
Time of everyday learning is very short (less than a minute), but preparing and organizing necessary materials takes a lot of time and energy. After a few weeks many parents give up becouse of lack of time. 
### Solution
Most of children watch cartoons. Program is compatible with the learning method of reading. In time when child is completle focussing on a screen parents can play sessions before cartoons.
